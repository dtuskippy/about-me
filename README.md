    * Help from Audrey with issues with Live Server; changed settings to set local IP as Host, and problem was solved

## Reflections

    * Despite the problems with Live Server, the project went really well; instructions were clear and jumped right in.
    * I look forward to working with JS functions.
    * It took approximately 2 hours to complete; without the Live Server issue, probably 90 minutes would have been enough.


## Lab 03

### Links and Resources

    * I had help from Audrey with issues with Live Server; did an uninstall and reinstall and it appears to have worked well enough, at least for today!
    * I also had help from Audrey adjusting settings on eslint.

## Reflections
    * I struggled with both questions 6 and 7 to some degree, but ground it out and solved them.
    * It took almost 4 hours to complete, and I thought it would take about 2 hours originally. 

## Lab 04

### Authors: Alan Chelko (Navigator) and Stephen Clemmer (Driver) worked on the code together

    * https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

## Reflections
    * I again had issues with Live Server, and did another uninstall/reinstall cycle to get it up and running properly
    * We struggled a bit experimenting with function wrapping and making the function calls, but no major hiccups.
    * We clearly are getting 'second nature' with git clone and push, but the git pull predictably took a bit more time.
    * It took about 45 minutes to complete, and I thought it would take about 30 minutes originally.

## Reflections
    * I just did a re-test of the site, and removed comment code like the console.log statements per spec.
    * It took about 15 minutes to run through everything, which tracks with what I anticipated.
