    * Help from Audrey with issues with Live Server; changed settings to set local IP as Host, and problem was solved

## Reflections

    * Despite the problems with Live Server, the project went really well; instructions were clear and jumped right in.
    * I look forward to working with JS functions.
    * It took approximately 2 hours to complete; without the Live Server issue, probably 90 minutes would have been enough.

### Links and Resources

    * Help from Audrey with issues with Live Server; did an uninstall and resinstall and it appears to have worked well enough, at least for today!
    * Also had help from Audrey adjust setting on eslint.

## Reflections
    * Struggled with both questions 6 and 7 to some degree, but ground it out and solved them.
    * It took almost 4 hours to complete, and I thought it would take about 2 hours originally.
