    * Help from Audrey with issues with Live Server; changed settings to set local IP as Host, and problem was solved

## Reflections
    * Despite the problems with Live Server, the project went really well; instructions were clear and jumped right in.
    * I look forward to working with JS functions.
    * It took approximately 2 hours to complete; without the Live Server issue, probably 90 minutes would have been enough.
